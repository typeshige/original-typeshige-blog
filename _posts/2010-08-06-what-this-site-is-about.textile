title: About this Site

I haven't blogged in over 10 years and I wanted to get back into it. I don't think _blog_ was even a word then.  My first site was written in vi or notepad as static html files and now, this site will hardly be any different.  Again, I'm using vi but instead of writing in html, I'm using Textile.  To publish, I'm experimenting with a static website generator called "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and it's being hosted on github.  So far, so good.
